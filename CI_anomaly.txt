Continuous Improvement:

1) Folder Layout should look like this:

> data dump 
	> plant 
		> QV
			> Sheets
			> Cartons
		> IG
			> csv 1
			> csv 2
			> csv 3
			> ...

Goal is from now on, we'll use python to traverse Plant by plant...
When it gets to CST, it'll load IG by 
APPENDING EVERY CSV TOGETHER to make a master database

Then when we create QV date dict, it will grab from the appropriate table when 74 is observed.

qv_sheet_table = QV > Sheets
qv_carton_table = QV > Cartons

I just need to name the files correctly then we're good...


2) What if I create a threshold bar...
So there will be "tiers" of anomalies... Slicer for Threshold
So instead of a simple "1" or "0", it'll be a threshold number...
EACH LINE WILL BE A THRESHOLD! ...
